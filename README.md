# Lab7-readme.
### Executive sumary
In Lab number 7. We covered what it means Compression through Zip and unzip files 
We learned to reduce file size and make it easier to transport or store
We all know about Python as a programming language. In object-oriented programming or OOP, the goal is to make reusable code patterns. In contrast to procedural programming, where we give a sequence of instructions.
### File Compression
### Explain the purpose and use of file compression
The main purpose of compressing a file is to make it smaller so that it takes up less space on your computer.Compressed (zipped) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files.
#### Traverse to your svg graphic file and right click on the file.  Select properties and note the file size.  Right-click on the file again and select "send to" compressed file (in Windows).  Right-click on the compressed file and select properties to again note the size.  Explain the difference in file size for a svg file vs. what you might experience if the file were a jpg file and why.  
According to the instructions I found a file in SVG format, and the size of the SVG file is 744 bytes, however I compare it with any JPG file the difference is in the size. A JPG file has a size in KB whereas in SVG it is mere bytes. Because SVG files are vector images and don't use as much memory on the PC while JPG files are more the bits
### Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
#### What are the methods and the property of the shark class? 
Methods are a special type of function that is defined inside a class. These functions are indented under the Shark class, they are called methods. Methods are a special type of function that is defined inside a class. A class called Shark that has two associated functions
### What is the purpose of a constructor? 
Also called the __init__ method, you can use it to initialize data. It is the first definition of any class.It is executed as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
### What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?
The argument to these functions is the word self, which is a reference to objects that are made based on this class. To reference instances (or objects) of the class, self will always be the first parameter, but it need not be the only one.Thus an object is a specific instance of a class; contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming.
### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
### Define OMG and describe the purpose of UML
The OMG defines the purposes of the UML as follows: To provide system architects, engineers, and software developers with the tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems, as well as for business process modeling and Similar.
### explain why you matched the terms as you did (under the Unified Modeling Language (UML) heading)
According to the latest program called Shark, we can learn how to build classes and define them in Python.

The object is a class instance. The class pairs up with Sammy. I used the samy shark object using two methods swin() and be awesome().
Class: In the last program, the class was represented as a bblueprint to the programmer of an object. I defined a class like Shark which has two functions, the first one is swimming and the other one is awesome.

An abstract class can be considered as a model for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created inside any child class created from the abstract class.

Encapsulation describes the idea of encapsulating data and the methods that work with data within a unit. A class is an example of encapsulation, since it encapsulates all data that is member functions, variables, etc. The goal of hiding information is to ensure that an object's state is always valid by controlling access to attributes that are hidden from the outside world.

Inheritance is the ability of a class to derive or inherit the properties of another class.
### Conclusion
In summary, lab number 7 was very practical because we covered how to compress files to ZIP. We did it through SVG files and converted it to ZIP, in the LabIT1025 folder. Additionally, we also learned to program in Python through the processes of Object Oriented Programming Concepts (OOP). We use the tutorials to create a shark program. We use Python IDLE and run the program. We then attach the screens on GitHub. Finally we went back to work on Lucichart, to recreate the shark program.
